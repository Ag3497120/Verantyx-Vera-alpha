"""The vocabulary as a lattice — atoms to compounds, kin by shared units.

`granularity` reads one layer: a word and the units that open and close
it. This module makes that reading recursive and lateral, the shape the
conception names: 電荷密度 decomposes to 電荷+密度, those to 電+荷 and
密+度, and at every level the words sharing a unit AT A POSITION are kin
— 電荷, 電気, 電子 under 電@L. Analysis walks down the lattice, synthesis
walks up it, and kin walks across; all three are the same structure read
in three directions.

## Every node is attested — the gate applies at every level

A lattice node is a vocabulary word (attested standalone, MIN_ATTEST
independent occurrences) or an atomic character observed inside such
words. Fragments never enter: 事訴 (inside 民事訴訟法) is not a node
because no corpus writes it standalone, and a lattice that admitted it
would relate real words through a string that is nobody's word. This is
the same sieve `granularity.verify` earned (4.9x -> 15x by dropping
fragments) applied as a membership rule.

## Kin requires position

賠償 earns its right-hand slot from 損害賠償, not from any string ending
in those characters. Kin under (電, L) and kin under (電, R) are
different families, kept apart — pooling them would relate 電荷 to
発電 through a slot neither occupies.

## Hand-over only

Nothing here enters a verdict, a census, or the concord band. The
lattice supplies structure: analysis trees for the explanation layer,
kin sets for meaning-prediction, unit inventories for synthesis
(`granularity.propose_units` remains the composer, measured at 15-16x
over chance).

## Measured — kin predicting a held-out word's facets

Lattice over the 51,798-word vocabulary: 41,540 words in range, 57,217
positional slots, 2,449 atoms. Protocol: the 150 held-out cores
(reach's protocol, script preserved at tools/measure_lattice.py), each
core's own top-10 facets as ground truth, every predictor blind to that
cross; the number is recall of those facets within the predictor's
top-20.

    kin, all units (atoms in)     recall 0.043   covers 140 of 150
    single richest unit (reach)   recall 0.044   covers  86 of 150
    kin, units >= 2 chars only    recall 0.034   covers 117 of 150
    20 random vocabulary words    recall 0.004

Two honest readings. Association does NOT sharpen: at equal precision
with the single-unit landing, kin recovers no more of a word's specific
meaning — 4% of the true facets is the measured ceiling for meaning by
family, ten times chance and nowhere near comprehension. Association
WIDENS: 86 -> 140 of 150 terms get a prediction at all, because a term
whose units are not held as cores still has kin under its units'
slots. And the atoms earn their place here — dropping them costs both
coverage (140 -> 117) and precision (0.043 -> 0.034), the reverse of
what the bare-suffix lesson suggested; a single character relates
weakly but its FAMILY aggregated still points at the right
neighbourhood.
