"""Long-form prose from the store — grammatical, not fluent, and never invented.

The distinction this module exists to test is a real one. Fluency is the
choice among many valid phrasings, and that choice is a distribution, learned
from use; rules cannot supply it, and adding rules until they collide is just
a hand-built worse version of one. But GRAMMATICALITY of a declarative
statement of fact is a small closed system — 「Xは Y です」, "X is Y" — and a
closed system is exactly what rules are for.

So this composes reports, not essays. The output is correct and monotonous.
For a situation report or a decision rationale, monotonous is the right
register: a responder reading about a road closure is not looking for
variety, and the sameness of the sentence shapes is what lets them scan.

The property that matters more than either:

    every sentence is traceable to a stored fact

`compose_report` returns the text and, alongside it, the facet each sentence
came from. `unsupported_sentences()` re-checks the whole output against the
store and returns anything that is not backed — which is always empty by
construction here, and is checked anyway, because "cannot hallucinate" is a
claim that should be tested rather than asserted.

Length comes from structure, not from padding: one section per arm, one
sentence per fact, one paragraph per source disagreement. A store with more
in it produces a longer report, and that is the only way this gets longer.
