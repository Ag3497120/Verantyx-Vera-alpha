"""What a field officer needs between one shift and the next.

Three things the audit page does not do, taken from what the IDE already
solved and rewritten in Vera's terms rather than copied.

    SESSIONS      `SessionMemoryArchiver` keeps chat history in zones —
                  front for the live one, near/mid for recent, far for
                  archived — so old material stays reachable without
                  crowding what is in front of you. A shift handover is the
                  same problem: the officer coming on at 22:00 needs
                  yesterday's audit findable and today's audit open.

    SEARCH        `ProjectSearchEngine` shells out to ripgrep over a repo.
                  A field officer's version of that question is not "which
                  file contains this string" but "what do we know about
                  天草市, and who said it" — so this searches the STORE, not
                  the bytes, and every hit carries the document it came from.

    SILENCE RATE  `ConfusionDetector` watches an LLM's replies for "I don't
                  know" and injects memory when it finds them. Vera has no
                  replies to watch, but it has something better: typed
                  refusals. A run that answers UNKNOWN_* most of the time is
                  the same situation, and it is far more actionable, because
                  the refusal already names WHICH thing is missing. So the
                  detector becomes a rate with the reason attached, and the
                  advice is a procedure rather than a guess.

All of it is local files under the operator's own directory, and none of it
takes a network. A field tool that needs a connection is a field tool that
stops working at exactly the moment it is needed.
