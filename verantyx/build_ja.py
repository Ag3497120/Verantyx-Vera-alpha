"""Build the Japanese federation and writer once, to a durable path.

Everything measured at 626MB was rebuilt from scratch each session, in a
session temp directory, from a corpus that has now been cleaned away twice.
The manifests were fixed so the corpus can be refetched; this is so the
things built ON it survive too — a federation ingest and a writer build cost
minutes each and are pure functions of inputs that are already pinned.

    <root>/bulk                e-Gov statute XML     egov_bulk_2026
    <root>/wikipedia_domains   lead sections         wikipedia_ja_domains_2026
    <root>/wikipedia_cited     whole articles        wikipedia_ja_cited_2026
    <root>/build/federation.pkl
    <root>/build/writer.json

The default root is deliberately NOT a temp directory and NOT inside the
repository: the corpus is third-party government and encyclopedia text that
this project publishes manifests for rather than redistributing.

Rebuilding is skipped when the outputs are newer than the corpus, and forced
with --rebuild. The skip is on mtime rather than a checksum because the
corpus is a directory of a thousand files and `corpus_fetch --verify` is the
tool that already answers the checksum question properly.
