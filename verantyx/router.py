"""Router — Vera as the controller that allocates work between itself and
an optional local LLM (制御配分).

Native harness behavior (no MCP, no triggers):
  * every declarative user utterance is auto-remembered into the store
  * every query runs Vera-first: math → code → knowledge consensus
  * the local LLM speaks only when Vera allows it, and always labeled:

      vera          deterministic grounded answer (LLM not consulted)
      llm_guided    LLM phrases an answer AROUND Vera's grounded facts
      llm_free      Vera has nothing (typed UNKNOWN); LLM may converse,
                    explicitly labeled as unverified
      refused       no LLM configured → the typed UNKNOWN itself is the answer

The allocation is deterministic; only the LLM's wording is not.
