"""A catalogue of a body of work — every entry traceable, the whole thing reproducible.

Point it at years of documents and it answers "what is in here": the topics,
what is said about each, which files said it, where the sources disagree, and
which of the six questions nobody answered. Not a summary — a summary is one
person's reading, and the reading is the part you cannot check.

Three properties, in the order a regulated buyer asks about them:

  Reproducible   The same corpus produces a byte-identical catalogue. The
                 manifest carries a hash of every input file, so a catalogue
                 can be tied to exactly the inputs that produced it and a
                 later run either matches or names what changed. Nothing here
                 samples, sorts by dict order, or calls a model.

  Traceable      Every claim carries the file it came from. `audit(topic)`
                 walks back from a line in the catalogue to the sentence in
                 the source document, which is the question an auditor
                 actually asks and the one a vector index cannot answer.

  Honest about coverage
                 `coverage` reports what fraction of sentences produced a
                 topic at all. A catalogue built from a corpus it mostly
                 failed to parse looks identical to one built from a corpus
                 it understood, unless the number is printed. It is printed.

What this is not: a ranking of importance. Topics are ordered by how often
they are discussed, which is a fact about the corpus, not a judgement about
the work.
