"""Japanese grammatical data — bundled, validated, and extensible without code.

The stopwords, antonym pairs, aspect joins, aliases and predicate forms used
to live as Python constants across three modules. That made the grammar a
programmer's possession: adding one vocabulary pair — a thing a domain expert
does, not a developer — meant editing source. Now the data ships as
`lang_data/ja_grammar.json` inside the package, and a user can lay an overlay
file beside their store to extend it, exactly the mechanism the failure packs
already use. Grammar is knowledge, and knowledge here is data with a loader,
never code.

Every load is validated, loudly. The rules encode lessons this project paid
for on real corpora, and an overlay that violates them would reintroduce the
same failures with an expert's name on them:

  * pair members must be ≥2 chars — substring matching over Japanese makes a
    single kanji a false-positive machine (開 sits inside 開始, 公開, 展開)
  * a term may carry one pole only — both sides of one aspect on one word is
    a contradiction generator, not a vocabulary
  * aliases and joins must point at terms/aspects that exist — a dangling
    reference would silently detect nothing
  * predicates should describe known terms — a predicate for an unknown term
    is usually a typo for one

An invalid overlay raises with every problem named. Refusing to load half a
grammar beats running with one: the visible failure costs a minute, the
silent one costs a wrong report with a citation on it.
