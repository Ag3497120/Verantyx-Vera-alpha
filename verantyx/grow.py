"""The refusal log as a standing work queue — growth where questions failed.

Measured before it was automated: 34 subjects the engine refused during one
week of operation, fetched by name, raised subject accuracy to 13/14 across
every suffix, moved 時効 from a one-document accident to a ranked answer
with three witnesses, and lifted ranked leads from 7/12 to 10/12. The fetch
list was not curated — it was derived from a stated rule, and that is what
makes the growth honest: the corpus thickens where the QUESTIONS said it
was thin, not where anyone thought it should.

    queue   vera.ask appends the subject of every UNKNOWN_NOT_PRESENT to
            $VERA_QUEUE (one JSON line each), when that variable is set.
            Off by default: an ask that writes files is a side effect a
            library must opt into, not perform silently
    grow    python3 -m verantyx.grow --queue refusals.jsonl
            dedupes, drops subjects the store meanwhile holds, fetches the
            rest by title with the rule recorded in the manifest, rebuilds,
            re-exports, verifies

Two verdicts stay OUT of the queue on purpose (see `remedy`): TIME_DEPENDENT
does not close by registration and NO_SUBJECT should not be closed — a
queue that accumulates unclosable items is a queue nobody trusts.
