"""AI-output ingestion — passive memory from an assistant's final text,
quarantined until a human reviews it.

Design covenant this module must not break: Vera never presents an
unverified claim as a fact. An LLM's own output (even its *final*, non-
thinking text) can be wrong, hedged, or exploratory — remembering it
directly into the trusted store would launder hallucination into
"verified, counted" memory, which is the one failure mode this whole
project exists to prevent.

So this module never writes into the main store. It only proposes
candidate sentences into a separate ``AiFactQuarantine`` — a holding area a
human (or the user, via ``vera review-ai-facts``) must explicitly accept
before anything reaches the trusted ``CrossStore``. Filters:

  - thinking/chain-of-thought text is out of scope by construction: callers
    must pass only an assistant's final visible reply, never a <thinking>
    block — this module has no signature that accepts one.
  - hedge-word sentences ("might", "probably", "I think", "seems", …) are
    dropped before they even reach quarantine — a sentence the model
    itself is unsure of should not become a fact candidate at all.
  - meta-commentary about the assistant's own process ("let me check",
    "I'll now run", "as an AI") is dropped — it is not world knowledge.
  - questions/imperatives/task-labeled text reuse ``lang.is_question`` —
    the same gate that stops "tell me something" from self-polluting chat.
