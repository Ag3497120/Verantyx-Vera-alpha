"""One entry point: a question in, a typed answer with its route out.

Everything measured this session sits in layers, and the layers only work
layered — six pooled combinations were worse, six layered ones better. This
wires them in the order the measurements put them:

    1  language     detect, and route to the sovereign built from that
                    language. Never a census across two: mixing them
                    answered superconductivity with contract
    2  deictic      「今日の天気は」 has no answer in a store with no clock.
                    Typed out before anything is looked up
    3  staircase    grain and grammar over the cores of that sovereign,
                    six settings for kanji and two for latin — character
                    windows collide at 26 letters and discriminate at 2,000
    4  core         the inference core, entered directly or seeded by the
                    staircase when it cannot enter at all. Sections converge
                    and the axis words along the agreed paths are the answer
    5  reach        when the term is not held: split it into units the
                    corpus attests (10.4% overlap) before falling back on a
                    longer word that contains it (4.5%)
    6  words        the path becomes the content and a harvested template
                    supplies only the form
    7  remedy       what an expert would register to close a refusal, and
                    which refusals should not be closed

Each stage hands the next something typed. None of them votes with another.

## Every answer says how it was reached

`ANSWER` is the core converging on the question as asked. `SEEDED` means the
staircase had to name the subject first. `UNITS` and `CONTAINMENT` are two
different ways of landing near a word the store never held, measured 16.3x
and 3.9x over chance, and reported apart because a reader discounting one
needs to know which they have.
