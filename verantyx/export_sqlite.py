"""The federation as one SQLite file — the form it can actually be published in.

`build_ja` writes `federation.pkl`, and pickle is the wrong thing to hand to
anyone. `pickle.loads` executes whatever the file says to execute, so a
published .pkl is a published code-execution primitive; that is why Hugging
Face scans for them and warns. It is also opaque — a reader who wants to
check a number in the model card cannot look inside it without running the
project's own code, which is the same circularity this project keeps trying
to remove from its measurements.

SQLite fixes both. The file loads without executing anything, and anyone can
audit the claims directly:

    sqlite3 vera.db "SELECT count(*) FROM cores"
    sqlite3 vera.db "SELECT facet, count FROM facets
                     WHERE core='正当防衛' ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 5"

## One file, not 6,037

`CrossStore.save()` already speaks SQLite, but a federation is a dict of
domain -> leaf -> store, and one file per leaf is not a distribution. The
leaf becomes a column instead, which is also what lets a reader ask which
statute division a facet came from — a question the per-store format cannot
answer at all.

## Both languages in one file, still two sovereigns

`lang` is a column, and `load` hands back one store per language exactly as
the pickle path did. Storing them together is not pooling them: nothing ever
queries across the column, because a cross-language census counts a tokenizer
collision as corroboration (see `polyglot`).

The distributed file must answer what the built one answers; `--verify`
checks that on a question bank rather than trusting the round trip.
