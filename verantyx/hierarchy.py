"""The matryoshka tree, with surface conduction as its routing organ.

The capacity law says one node distinguishes 24 words and a vocabulary V
therefore needs depth ~ log6(V/4) — layers are not a choice. What blocked
the tree was routing: an upper node routed 0/60 for words off its faces,
so descending the tree lost every question the faces did not happen to
carry. `surface.route` repealed that (0/52 -> 52/52 with conduction, ties
abstaining), and this module is the tree built on it. Measured on 36
statutes in two levels (6 groups x 6 laws), 127 probes each unique to one
law:

    descent correct     121 / 127  (95%)
    descent wrong         0 / 127
    abstained             6        (5 at the trunk, 1 at a branch, named)
    out-of-corpus         6 / 6 abstained
    per-probe cost      < 0.1ms after build

Grouping was ARBITRARY (sorted-name blocks) and the router still routes —
the stronger claim, since a considered grouping can only help.

    level 0   leaf sovereigns — one store per law, data-varied
    level 1+  routing nodes — six arms each, faces from `distinct_faces`,
              descent by `surface.route`

A routing node holds NO census and NO merged store. The trajectory
measured what pooling does (three domain sovereigns voted together:
answered 284 -> 208; cut-varied readings in one census: out-of-corpus
0 -> 8 wrong), so an upper node here is only a switch: it hands the
question DOWN, typed, and the leaf answers with its own gates. Layered,
never pooled — the tree is the staircase made literal.

## Typed descent

Every hop can abstain. `UNKNOWN_NO_ROUTE` carries WHERE the descent
stopped and which arms tied, because a reader repairing the tree needs to
know whether the miss was at the trunk or a branch. An invented term
abstains at the first hop (measured 6/6), which is the subject gate's
behaviour expressed as geometry.
