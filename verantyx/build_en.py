"""Build the English sovereign to a durable path — the builder that was missing.

`build_ja` has existed since the corpus was lost twice. `english.pkl` did
not: the English sovereign was built once, by hand, in a session that is
gone, and nothing in this repository could reproduce it. That is the same
failure the manifests were written to end, one level up — a published
artifact nobody can rebuild is a number nobody can check, including us.

    <root>/wikipedia_en        whole articles      wikipedia_en_2026
    <root>/build/english.pkl

One store, not a federation. The Japanese side splits into leaves because
statutes carry their own divisions and routing through them tells a reader
why a question went where it went; 764 encyclopedia articles have no such
structure to route through, and inventing one would be clustering dressed as
provenance.

Deliberately NOT merged with the Japanese federation. A single store holding
both cannot be asked in either — the English decomposer collapses
「Article 199 provides for homicide」 onto the core `article`, which then
competes with 刑法第百九十九条 in a census over items neither reader produced.
See `polyglot`.
