"""The local web application, built to field-software rules rather than to taste.

Runs on 127.0.0.1 with the Python standard library, makes no network call of
any kind, and reads documents that never leave the machine. That is the whole
reason it exists as a separate thing from the public demo: a municipal officer
has drafts, shelter registers and hospital lists in front of them, and the
correct place for those is nowhere.

The interface follows the conventions of software people actually operate
under pressure, which are not the conventions of a marketing page:

    the primary action is always on screen        never behind a menu, never
                                                  below a fold; an officer
                                                  should never hunt for "read
                                                  these documents"
    every state is named in words                 no bare spinner. "読み取り中
                                                  (12/40)" tells you whether
                                                  to wait; a rotating circle
                                                  does not
    a refusal says what to do next                UNKNOWN_* already names what
                                                  is missing, so the screen
                                                  can carry the procedure. A
                                                  message that only reports
                                                  failure leaves someone to
                                                  invent the next step at two
                                                  in the morning
    the quiet number comes first                  coverage and opposable pairs
                                                  sit ABOVE the findings,
                                                  because a list of detections
                                                  read without knowing that
                                                  60% went unread is a list
                                                  trusted for the wrong reason
    words, not icons                              an icon means something
                                                  different in every agency;
                                                  a label means one thing
    everything within two clicks                  six sections, all in one
                                                  bar, no nesting
    keyboard first                                Ctrl/Cmd+Enter runs, / goes
                                                  to search — people who use a
                                                  tool all day stop using the
                                                  mouse
    guidance where the question is                each section carries its own
                                                  short explanation inline, so
                                                  nobody has to find a manual
                                                  while a phone is ringing
    high contrast, large targets                  a laptop on a folding table
                                                  in a gymnasium, in daylight

Nothing decorative. Every pixel that is not information was removed on
purpose, and the sections are ordered the way the work actually happens:
read documents → see what is contested → look up one place → check the
engine's own defects → decide the vocabulary queue.
