"""A framed instruction as a chain that circulates, not a list that drains.

The problem
-----------
`intent_frames.parse` returns compounds flat:

    teamsを開いて課題を確認して
        {"op": ["OPEN", "CHECK"], "args": [{...}, {...}]}

Two frames side by side, with nothing between them. So execution becomes
enter-structure → leave → execute outside → enter again, and whatever the
first stage produced is gone by the time the second one runs. Wiring the
Teams route by hand worked only because a human held the thread.

The relation was never missing from the STRUCTURE. `arm_schema` already
carries it: what OPEN produces is its cause- arm, and what CHECK needs in
order to run is its cause+ arm, and those are the same fact seen from two
sides. The flat list is where it gets thrown away.

So a chain, and the chain circulates
------------------------------------
Each stage is a small cross. Stage n's cause- is stage n+1's cause+. A
stage does not receive arguments; it READS its own cause+ arm, and after
it runs its result is written onto its cause- — which is the next stage's
precondition, already in place.

Three things fall out of that one change, which is the reason to believe
it is the right shape rather than a rearrangement:

    handoff        the cause arms carry it; nobody passes anything
    precondition   a stage whose cause+ is empty cannot run — free
    progress       a lap that places no new arm has not advanced

Stopping
--------
A loop that watches itself can watch itself forever; that is the qwen
degeneration in different clothes. So termination is structural, never a
guessed iteration cap:

    STALLED        a lap placed no new arm. Nothing was learned, so
                   another identical lap will learn nothing either.
    BLOCKED        no stage is ready and none is done — the chain needs
                   something from outside (usually the person).
    UNKNOWN_BUDGET the recorded budget ran out with work still pending.
    DONE           every stage delivered.

Layering
--------
Laps are held here, not written into the store. Intermediate state and
settled fact in one layer is the flat-federation contamination this
project has already measured; the caller lifts finished stages across
deliberately (束ねず重ねる).
