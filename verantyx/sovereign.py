"""Documents in, one sovereign node out — the whole procedure, run for real.

Everything the tree needs was measured separately. This assembles it into an
ordered build, because the order matters and each stage constrains the next:

    1  ingest      documents -> one store per domain, kept SEPARATE
    2  simulate    per-domain placement, gated on held-out questions
    3  plan        capacity -> how many layers this vocabulary requires
    4  assemble    routers, with intermediate layers inserted where needed
    5  federate    domain nodes under one sovereign
    6  verify      descend real questions and record what refused

Nothing here is new machinery. `egov` and `document_ingest` do stage 1,
`placement` does stage 2, `hierarchy` does 3–5. What this module adds is the
sequence and the refusal to skip a stage — a tree assembled without stage 2
routes on whichever four facts sorted first, and the measurement that
motivated the whole design says that is the difference between a 30.9% and a
13.2% fabrication rate.

## Why stage 3 cannot be a preference

A node has six arms and four fact faces, so it routes on 24 terms and, past
that, on nothing: measured, terms on the faces reached the right domain 20
of 24 times and terms off them 0 of 60. Depth follows arithmetically,

    depth ~= log6(V / 4)

and `plan` reports it rather than accepting a number from the caller. A
caller who wants a shallower tree is asking for a router that cannot route.

## Why the leaves stay apart

Flat, the six statutes here share 184 terms across three or more of them and
行為 across all six; 民法's 法律行為 is not 刑法's. Merging domains into one
store is the failure this shape exists to avoid, so no stage ever writes two
domains into the same CrossStore — `_merged` in `hierarchy` builds a view for
ranking router terms and is never what a question is answered from.
