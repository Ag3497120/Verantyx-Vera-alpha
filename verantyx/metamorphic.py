"""Prove a defect from inside, with no answer key and nobody reading.

`self_audit` found the SHAPES a defect leaves and stopped there, on purpose:
a shape is a suspicion, the ranges overlap with correct output, and no
procedure inside the engine can decide whether its own reading of a sentence
is right. That boundary is real and this module does not cross it.

It goes around it. There is a second question that IS decidable from inside:

    not   "is this reading correct?"      — needs the world
    but   "do two readings of the SAME CONTENT agree?" — needs only the store

If they disagree, one of them is wrong. That is a proof, not a suspicion, and
it costs no human and no network. What makes it usable is that for some
transformations the direction is decidable too:

    LAYOUT CANNOT ADD INFORMATION.

A space between two kanji is put there by a PDF extractor, not by the author —
Japanese does not space its words. So if collapsing that space makes a claim
DISAPPEAR, the claim was manufactured by the layout, and it is spurious. Not
"suspicious": spurious, because no arrangement of whitespace can be evidence
that a town has water.

Measured on the defect that started this: 「７月 30 日 から 全 12 戸 が 断水」
reads as a claim about 全, and the same sentence without the extractor's
spaces reads as a claim about 全12戸. The first is a fragment. No one had to
read either to know that one of them is wrong.

The probes, and why each preserves meaning:

    counter_split A numeral and the counter after it — 12戸, 15炉 — are one
                  word, and a space between them is column alignment. The one
                  repair that measured FREE: 5 proven defects gone, and the
                  corpus placed the same 18,460 sentences afterwards.
    layout_space  A single space between two CJK characters. Japanese has no
                  inter-word space, so in prose it is always the extractor.
                  Table rows are EXCLUDED — `_is_table_row` exists because a
                  row's single spaces are column separators, and collapsing
                  those would change meaning rather than restore it.
    digit_width   ７ and 7 are the same digit. Nothing weaker to argue.
    doc_order     The order documents arrive in is not part of what they say.
                  Symmetric: neither reading is canonical, they must agree.
    reread        Reading the same document twice must add nothing. The
                  user's own test — "if re-reading is enough to evolve it" —
                  requires this to hold, or the second read is not a re-read.

What is filed as PROVEN and what is not. Only the manufactured direction:
a claim present in the noisy reading and absent in the clean one. The reverse
— a claim the clean reading has and the noisy one lacks — is filed as
suspected, because a document whose layout carries structure can legitimately
read differently, and a normalisation that flattens a table is not a fix.

    separator are the same character and only the loader knows which it has.

    「日時 開催場所 担当部署」, three table headers, into one word. The

    proven, and the loop was measuring a repair it would never make.

    Toggling the real switch and reloading makes probe and repair the same
