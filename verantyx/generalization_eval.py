"""Planted ground truth on corpora the pipeline was never tuned on.

Every other suite in this package pins a defect that a REAL corpus exposed —
which is the right way to fix defects and the wrong way to claim generality:
a pipeline polished against one archive may simply have memorised its shape.
This suite generates its corpora, from vocabulary chosen to overlap nothing
in the archives used during development, and knows the right answer in
advance because it planted it.

It also measures the number nothing else measures: RECALL. The false-
positive work drove contradictions on the development corpus from 24 to 0,
and 0 proves nothing about detection — a detector that never fires also
scores 0. Here, contradictions exist by construction, and the question is
how many come back.

Two tiers, reported separately and held to different standards:

  Tier A — canonical claim forms ("The X is open." / 「Xは開設されました。」).
           Recall must be 100%. These are the forms the subject gate was
           designed around; missing one is a regression, not a limitation.

  Tier B — harder phrasings (passive, adverbs between subject and state,
           formal register). Recall is MEASURED AND PRINTED, with a floor of
           zero. This is the honest number for "what would this miss in the
           wild", and pinning it to today's value would freeze a limitation
           in place as if it were a specification.

Precision is asserted at 100% on both tiers together: the planted traps
(compound nouns, prepositional on/off, subordinate clauses) must produce
nothing, whatever else happens. A missed disagreement costs one finding;
an invented one costs the reader's trust in all of them.
