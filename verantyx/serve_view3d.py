"""Serve the 3D view next to the engine and stream what a query touches.

A published artifact cannot do this. Its CSP blocks every external host and
neither runtime capability the platform offers (`downloads`, `mcp`) opens
one, so a page on claude.ai has no way to reach a Python process on this
machine. Saying otherwise would be a promise the browser refuses to keep.

Served from here it is a same-origin fetch and works. The page detects
which case it is in and says so rather than pretending — "未接続 — 静的表示"
against "接続 — 推論を可視化中".

What is streamed is what the engine actually consults, not a replay: each
setting of `GradedJudge` is asked in turn and the cores its rungs scored are
emitted as they are scored. A visualisation that animated a plausible path
instead would be the same failure as a generated sentence arriving where a
citation is expected.
