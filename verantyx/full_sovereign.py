"""A sovereign with every stage in it, not just the ladder.

`constellation.staircase` builds its members out of `resolution.Ladder`
alone. That is why seven of them take 1.5 seconds, and it is also why the
machinery this package spent most of its measurements on was sitting
unwired: placement 699 lines, hierarchy 552, granularity 369, links 216, all
built and none of them reached by a sovereign.

This assembles one member out of all of them, at one setting, so the census
can be run over sovereigns that actually contain what the design says a
sovereign contains — and so the cost of each stage is a number rather than
an assumption.

    1  leaves      the federation as ingested, per source
    2  placement   simulated per leaf; accepted only where it measures better
    3  units       `granularity` splits terms the corpus attests as units
    4  links       `links` bridges a doctrinal name to the article it cites
    5  tree        `hierarchy` binds leaves under their own divisions
    6  ladder      `resolution` indexes cores at this member's grain

Stages 3 and 4 exist because coarsening reaches unseen WORDS and not unseen
MEANINGS: it answered 漁業法第百一条 with 鉱業法第百一条, sharing a numeral
and none of the facets, and it cannot reach 殺人罪 -> 刑法第百九十九条 at
all unless the two share characters. Units attack that from the form side
and links from the citation side.

## What each stage is allowed to do

Add a way to reach a leaf. None of them may add a FACT: a link records that
one document cited another, a unit records that the corpus writes a
substring on its own, and neither invents content. That is the same rule
placement was measured against — placement cannot add information — and the
reason the stages can be composed without asking which one is authoritative.
