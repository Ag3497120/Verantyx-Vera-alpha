"""Sovereigns in parallel, with nothing above them.

Measured, a single apex is a routing ceiling: one root has six arms and four
faces, so it distinguishes 24 terms and no depth beneath it raises that.
Asked 1,536 anticipated questions it placed 24; the same tree queried at its
twelve field roots in parallel placed 220. A sovereign is good for identity
and governance and bad for routing, because routing capacity is per-root and
one root is one ceiling.

So a constellation has no top. Each sovereign holds the whole corpus at its
own SETTING — a grain size, a knowledge depth, a grammar — and a question
goes to all of them at once. What comes back is not one answer but a census:
how many sovereigns spoke, and how many said the same thing.

    resolution   whole / 3-char / 2-char / 1-char grains
    depth        how many facts per item were indexed at all
    grammar      raw, suffix-stripped, compound-split

Those three were each measured to carry signal on their own. Resolution
graded doubt (unanimity 100%, a lone rung 29.8%); depth did the same (98.1%
against 14.0%); grammar did not, on the ladder, and is kept selectable so
the placement stays a measurement.

## Why this is not the matryoshka again

`matryoshka_consensus` copies the same shell upward and re-searches it —
measured cell-for-cell identical, 6 arms of 6, an identity map. A
constellation's members are not copies. They index the same documents
differently, so they can disagree, and disagreement is the only thing an
agreement signal can be made of.

## Measured at 626MB

Eight sovereigns over the same 5,401 leaves — four resolutions, three
knowledge depths, one alternate grammar — built in 4 seconds, 1,200 probes
answered in 7:

    single sovereign (one 4-rung ladder)    964/1200   80.3%
    constellation (8 in parallel)          1012/1200   84.3%

    agreeing   probes   accuracy
        7          44    100.0%
        6          92    100.0%
        5         191    100.0%
        4         499    100.0%
        3         119     97.5%
        2          88     67.0%
        1         145      7.6%
        0          22        --

Four or more concurring covers 69% of the probes and was right every time.
The staircase the design asked for is that column: not a single verdict with
a hidden confidence, but a count a reader can act on differently at 7 than
at 2.

## What a constellation must never do

Vote a wrong answer into a right one. Members that split are reported split;
the reader is told how many spoke and how many concurred, and a bare
majority is labelled as such. The calibration for those bands belongs to a
corpus and a question shape and has to be rebuilt — see `resolution`.
