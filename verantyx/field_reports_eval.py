"""Does a field report reach a verdict someone can act on — or safely not?

The measurement that produced this module: ten realistic resident postings
(「ここ給水やってる」「水もうないです」) yielded a usable state in ZERO of
them, because the engine reads formal announcements and residents do not
write formally. This suite pins the design answer — statuses are chosen,
not written — and the verdicts that make a chosen status worth trusting.

The asymmetry every case here is built around: a wrong "usable" sends
someone carrying a baby two kilometres to a closed door. A wrong "we
cannot say" costs them one phone call. So the suite is strict about
EXPIRED and CONFLICT never being softened into a usable answer, and
relaxed about the reverse.
