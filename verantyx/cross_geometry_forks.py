"""Forks for the three unbuilt pieces of the original conception:
geometric visibility (E1), memory stacking, and placement granularity (E3).

Same contract as every other *_forks module: each fork states its expected
outcome as a pass criterion and returns evidence. Two disciplines carried
over from the rest of this work:

  - E1 does NOT declare a winner between ring and geometric visibility.
    The conception's "attack a nuance from both poles" reading can justify
    either topology; which one reasons better is the designer's question
    and needs real queries. What a fork CAN pin down is the structural
    difference itself — that the two modes disagree about exactly one
    thing, opposite-pole visibility — so the later A/B measures topology
    and nothing else.

  - The drift fork constructs the telephone-game failure on purpose and
    asserts it surfaces as UNKNOWN_DRIFT, not as a confident wrong answer.
    An extended-inference engine whose failure mode is silent topic drift
    would be worse than no engine.

    """More rungs help where the answer is in doubt, and CORE identity is not.

    A staircase of resolutions grades doubt: on LEAF routing, measured here
    over 600 probes through `gather(concord=True)`, one agreeing rung is
    right 19.3% of the time and three are right 67.7% — the mechanism works,
    which the earlier 29.8% -> 100% measurement on statute captions found
    first.

    Adding g1, g4, g5 beside whole/g3/g2 for CORE identification did not
    reproduce that, and the banding says why rather than contradicting it:

        6 settings    1 rung 96.9%   2+ rungs 100%
        11 settings   1 rung 95.3%   3+ rungs 100%

    A single rung is already right 96.9% of the time, so there are three
    points of doubt for a staircase to grade and eleven rungs cannot find
    them. What the extra rungs did find was two out-of-corpus words to
    answer wrongly, 0 -> 2. Naming a subject is near-exact matching; picking
    a leaf out of thousands is not, and only the second has room.

    Twice I measured this with a probe the machinery does not answer — first
    on variants, where a single rung already succeeds, then by querying a
    name-indexed judge with facets, which inverted the banding entirely
    (1 rung 55.8%, 3 rungs 1.0%). The staircase was never in question; the
    probe was.

    leave one thing standing. 殺人 + 死刑 leaves seven; adding 無期 leaves
    刑法第百九十九条 alone.

    Monotone, so there is no relaxation to run — each condition can only
    remove candidates, the descent has no local minimum, and it needs no
    temperature and no weights. A node is a filter, not an ALU: 24 terms and
    "is this among them", composed as conjunctions over one store.

    The ceiling is what conditions a reader supplies. Three conditions that
    leave three candidates cannot be resolved by a fourth the structure
    invents, and `UNKNOWN_UNDERDETERMINED` says so instead of choosing.

    the staircase names by coarsening, 185 answered and all 185 landed on
    the core the question was built from.

    The seed is the subject ALONE. Adding its facets dilutes it — 113 of 120
    with the subject only against 53 with four by frequency, 35 with all of
    them — because each added term is another section that must agree. That
    also removes the last arbitrary choice: there is no list left to sort.

    A seeded answer is typed `SEEDED`, never promoted to `ANSWER`. The entry
    was widened by coarsening and that is precisely what a reader needs in

    Two generators existed and did not meet. The inference core already

    「過失 故意」 comes back 「過失 法学 結果的加重犯 引 故意」: the answer,

    `writer` composes sentences and ignores the question. Seeded with 過失

    its second sentence. The WALK drifted; the composition did not.

    71% of converged paths produce no sentence because the centre is a

    expansions, scored against 20M held-out characters for whether the
    admitted terms are words the held-out text also writes:

        current vocabulary                52% real   centres speakable 32%

    and fragments words — 小林一三, 各出展, 物価統制令第三十八条. The one
    that raised quality added 6,776 terms at a HIGHER attestation rate than
    the vocabulary already had and moved the speakable share by nothing,
    because the terms it recovered (北航路, 絶縁物, 放牧地) are not the
    centres that fail.

    Nor is the subject choice a lever. Letting any path node be the subject
    lifts sentences from 29% to 85% and drops on-topic from 100% to 34%:
    「新路線とは」 became 「上祐の事態がある」. Restricting the subject to a
    query term returns exactly 29% — the centre already IS the query term
    almost always, so there is nothing to gain and a question to lose.

    Re-placing cannot do this; placement cannot add information. Changing

    words took cores-in-vocabulary from 43% to 60% with retrieval still
    300/300 on names.

    reach at all. The casualties are 空港法施行規則, 特定建築物所有者,
    第八十六条第十三項, 第一条中健康保険法第七条 — 7% are explicit article
    names, and they are what a legal system exists to answer about. The same
    operation drops 史上34人目 and 2015年4月1日現在, which nobody wants, and
